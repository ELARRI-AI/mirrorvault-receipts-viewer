# mirrorvault-receipts-viewer
MirrorVault Receipt Viewer — the public verification layer for ELARRI’s proof system. A lightweight, API-driven web app that displays and verifies digital receipts generated by the MirrorVault Codex engine.

## 🧩 Overview

This viewer renders canonical **MirrorVault receipts** (verifiable proof artifacts) and performs live seal verification using the `/v1/getReceipt/{id}` and `/v1/verifySeal` API endpoints.

It powers links such as:

https://verify.mirrorvault.ai/view.html?id=rcpt_01HZX


When opened, the page:

1. Fetches the receipt JSON from the API.  
2. Displays all core metadata, seals, and anchors.  
3. Calls the verifier endpoint to confirm authenticity.  
4. Renders a green “✓ Verified” badge if everything passes.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Open **`view.html`** and set your API paths inside the config section:

```js
const CONFIG = {
  API_BASE: "https://api.mirrorvault.ai",
  VERIFY_BASE: "https://api.mirrorvault.ai",
  RECEIPT_ID: null
};


🚀 Deployment

Option 1 — Vercel
1. Sign in at vercel.com using GitHub.
2. “Import Project” → choose this repository.
3. Framework preset: Other (Static Site).
4. Build command: none.
5. Output directory: /.
6. Deploy → you’ll get a test URL like https://mirrorvault-receipts-viewer.vercel.app.
Option 2 — Netlify
1. Sign in at netlify.com.
2. New Site → Import from GitHub → select this repo.
3. Build command: none.
4. Publish directory: /.
Domain Connection
Add a CNAME in Namecheap:
Host	Type	Value
verify	CNAME	cname.vercel-dns.com (Vercel) or your Netlify site URL
After propagation, https://verify.mirrorvault.ai will serve your viewer automatically.


🧠 How It Works
1. Proof creation → /v1/storeProof The backend signs and anchors data.
2. Receipt fetch → /v1/getReceipt/{id} The viewer retrieves the proof bundle.
3. Seal verification → /v1/verifySeal The viewer verifies cryptographic integrity.
4. Transparency anchors → blockchain / logs ensure public accountability.
